## NPM Scripts



`npm run start` - Start the production server



`npm run build` - Build the production code



`npm run build:analyze` - Build the production code and open the bundle analyzer to get a better idea of how your bundle size is made up. Useful for debugging large bundle size issues or proactively reducing bundle size



`npm run dev` - Start the development server



`npm run test` - Run tests



`npm run codegen` - Generate new typescript definitions based on the current GraphQL schema present in the api package



## Codegen

GraphQl codegen is used to generate typescript definitions for GraphQL schema types and also to generate React Hooks that can be used in place of directly using `useQuery` each time. You can see the output of this in the file:

`packages/web/src/shared/graphql/generated/graphql.tsx`
