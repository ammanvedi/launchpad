/**
 * Terraform works on a basis of comparing the action that you would like to take to the
 * state of teh real world. Because of this difficulties will arise from time to time
 * when external services perform any transformations on the inputs we give them. As this
 * would immediately lead to the state of the real world differing from the desired state
 * immediately after it was applied.
 *
 * Logically this will lead to the state being refreshed every time we make a change
 * regardless if we changed that specific piece of the infrastructure, the knock on effect
 * of this can be the infrastructure re deploying when it does not need to which is a waste
 * of resources
 *
 * Well we have a situation like this when it comes to secret storage in digital ocean.
 * When we send a plaintext value of a secret environment variable to digital ocean it will
 * take this value and encrypt it. taking it from that value to a string looking like
 *
 * EV:[daksdjadjlad.....
 *
 * now this means that the next time we try to set the secret, as described earlier we will
 * see a diff in terraform that is not the result of us making an actual change but
 * is rather a reflection of this problem.
 *
 * So we need to combat this somehow and we do have a few options
 *
 * 1. ignore the changes
 * This is potentially a good solution, we use terraform to set the envar once
 * and then we manage it in the digitalocean console ourselves after that
 * although a downside is that its just one more place we can forget to update it
 * should it change. However unfortunately there is an issue open for this at time of
 * writing that prevents us setting these envars to be ignored
 *
 * https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/26359
 *
 * 2. store the value unencrypted
 * This would solve the issue in the sense that digital ocean would not perform any encryption
 * and the value would be stored as is, so it is tempting, however its very bad practice
 * so we will pretend we were never tempted
 *
 * 3. deal with the re creation of resources
 * We could just allow the change to be made and deal with the fact that our application
 * will have a new image spun up. But this also feels like bad practice since we are
 * wasting resources for no reason so we want to avoid this also
 *
 * 4. encrypt the value ourself
 * This initially sounded like a good idea to me, we dont use the Do encryption but instead we
 * encrypt the value ourselves and we decrypt it in the app, but in order to tell the app
 * how to decrypt that information we would have to pass it a key, or an api key if we were
 * to use something like Hashicorp Vault, so really we dont avoid using secrets, which means
 * we would again have the same problem. So we can bin this brain fart
 *
 * 5. reflect the encrypted token
 * Save the most acceptable till last. What we can do is follow this process
 * 1. Set plaintext secret name via a github repository secret
 * 2. apply changes to digital ocean infrastructure
 * 3. pull the encrypted secret from the digital ocean api
 * 4. update the github environment variable
 *
 * The downside here is that we will need a separate environment variable to pass secrets to
 * digital ocean in order to not affect other services that dont need this behaviour. For
 * me this is acceptable. And i plant to make it manageable via documentation
 *
 * which i will write
 *
 * ...
 *
 * The purpose of this code is to perform that reflection
