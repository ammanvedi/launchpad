setup a s3 bucket to store your s3 configs

https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/types/s3.html

make sure you have the correct permissions

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:ListBucket",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::mybucket"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["s3:GetObject", "s3:PutObject"],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::mybucket/path/to/my/key"
    }
  ]
}
```


this setup does not LOCK STSTAE

https://www.terraform.io/docs/state/locking.html

you should also update the backend configs in each environment as terraform does nto allow you to
set these up with envars so youll have to do it manually

the purpose of a secret is to be secret, however this causes a problem for terraform
https://github.com/digitalocean/terraform-provider-digitalocean/issues/514
https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/26359

1. ignore changes there
2. store the value unencrypted
3. deal with the recreation
4. self encrypt the value

make sure you set up the s3 bucket to store terraform congiof
